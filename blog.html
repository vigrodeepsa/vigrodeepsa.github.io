<h2 class="article_heading">intro</h2>
In a recent clip posted on <b> Pharrell William's </b> <a href="#">  Instagram </a>and <a href="#"> Twitter </a>feeds, 
the American star producer and musician shares kind words about his experience 
at Chanel’s Senegal-hosted fashion show backed by the sounds of Vigro Deep’s
 “Africa Rise,” an unlikely, boundary-crossing amapiano hit by the 21-year-old
  South African-born producer/DJ.

Since his thrilling emergence in 2018, Vigro Deep has remained imaginative.
 His unique use of the log drum — characterised by its thundering, rolling effect,
  and the pause-and-trickling bass of earlier hits like “Black Power” and “Untold Stories,
  ” caught the masses' attention. While he became a household name for this distinctive
   and easily recognized sound between then and 2020’s Rise Of A Baby Boy, Vigro has
    since revamped it and created a mosaic by pairing contemporary electro and techno 
    elements and sensibilities with amapiano. He started toying with this composite 
    style on the last installment of his Baby Boy album series, Baby Boy 4, which 
    came out in May 2021

<h2 class="article_heading">Keep Hush Mix</h2>

<div class="art">
In an interview published in August 2021, the inventive, 
Pitori-hailing producer was reluctant to describe his sound as just amapiano. 
“I’ll say it’s more like electro-house music,” he revealed. “You know,
 I’m making music for the world, not just for Africa, not just for South Africa.
  I’m making music out of the box, that’s why I’m very creative when I make my music.
   I make motion tracks where there’s a whole lot of things in there.”
<br>

<br>
<a href="./albums/far_away_from_home">Far Away From Home</a>’s pre-released lead single, “I Am Vigro Deep” also offered
 a sneak peek of what was to come. Dark, hollow, and thunderous instrumentation
  underpin a vigorous poem that wonders what would happen if Vigro Deep went deep.
  <p>
   The lines, “If I go deep / Will people pray for my <u>downfall</u> /Or just wait to see
    /  If I <u>go bleak?”</u> instantly stand out. Going deep for Vigro meant <b> going against
     the grain </b> or <b>what had become a norm, stylistically, to mainstream Amapiano in 2021.</b>
     “If I go deep / Will people realise that I just <u> do beats</u> </i>/  And I don't <u>speak?</u>
       / If I go deep / Will people know that, I'm just Vigro deep?” Uncredited 
       and euphoric vocal/vox samples that he says he got from <a href="#"><b>Skrillex</b></a>, who has
        since become his <b> acquaintance/collaborator</b>, fuel the album along with
         heavy bass-driven percussions.
   </p>
   
   <p>
   While countless recent amapiano songs and projects are filled with collaborations 
   between vocalists and co-producers, <a href="#">Vigro</a> opted for minimalism. He is the sole
    contributor on most of the tracks, the majority of them being instrumentals 
    — which in a way is reminiscent of his and the genre’s past. Though rooted in
     ‘piano, <a href="#">Far Away From Home</a> is forward-looking and Europe-facing, all but one
      of the vocals and song titles are in English.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      My dream is to get to <a href="#"> Spain</a>.
       [With] the sound that I do, 
       I think of Ibiza type [of places and festivals],
        Tomorrowland. That’s what I’m looking for,
         that’s what I’m looking at, that’s what I’m 
         currently working at,” he told CNN, in their January
          2022 released <a href="#"> mini-documentary </a> on amapiano.
          </p>
          
          Vigro’s dream would crystallize months later. In July 2022, 
          “<b>Africa Rise</b>,” “<b>Some Attitude</b>,” and “<b>I Am Vigro Deep</b>” blasted
           through gigantic speakers in Ibiza during a <a href="#">Boiler Room show</a>,
            where the internationally acclaimed duo, <b> Major League DJz</b>, 
            UK-based DJs Charisse C and Ade Smilez rendered sets.
           <b> LuuDadeejay</b>, who works closely with the twins, 
             is the project’s sole co-producer on the track “<b>Number</b>,”
              while Vigro’s frequent collaborators, <b>DJ Bucks</b>, <b>Yashna</b>, 
              and <b>Neo Ndawo</b> make vocal appearances on “<b>In The Dark</b>”
               and “<b>Fire & Ice</b>,” respectively. Much like his adored, 
              <strike> unr*leased</strike> but <strike>le*ked</strike> remake of Bring Me The Horizon’s 
               “<b>Can You Feel My Heart</b>,” Vigro also put his peculiar
                spin on <b>Amaarae’s</b> viral track “<b>SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY</b>,”
                 which he says were both supposed to be on <b>Far Away From Home</b>.

<p>
Towards the tail end of the body of work reverberates the cheekily-titled “<b>Some Old Song.</b>”
 The track borrows the melody of <a href="#">Joakin’s</a> remix of “<a href="#">Camino Del Sol</a>” by <a href="#">French-Belgian
  trio Antena</a> — which was popular in  <b>South Africa</b> in the 2000s and was famously interpolated
   on rapper <b>Kwesta’s</b> 2016 hit “<b>Ngud</b>.” Vigro’s take on the song gave it a creative and futuristic
    facelift, contrasting the common direct manipulation of the original. In another interview
     published on Oct 22, Vigro revealed that 70% of Far Away From Home was done in London. 
     And that he wanted “to create something new, to target the European market.”
</p>

<p>
When asked in a recent podcast, if he felt that South Africans underappreciated
 Far Away From Home, Vigro quickly disagreed, detailing that his countrymen were
  not the primary audience for the effort because of how different it is.
   He acknowledges how the LP was better received outside of his home country,
    and that South Africans “got it later.” As he regularly tours Europe, 
    it’s evident that his productions have traveled far away from home, as
     he initially intended.

<h2 class="article_heading">'YOUR PIANO IS NOT MY PIANO'</h2>
<div class="art">
<p>
In his December 2022-released album, My House My Rules, Vigro Deep welcomes listeners
 with an anthemic track that contains a <b> computerized voice </b>towards the end.
  In a bid to trance-induce or prequel what is to come, the voice defines what hypnosis 
  is and describes some of its characteristics.
</p>

<p>
In many ways, the genre-melding offering follows in the direction of its predecessor 
with plentiful use of synths, arena-ready build-ups, mega breaks, and drops. 
These are again accompanied by minimum features and collaborations.
 Snenaah and M.J lend their vocals on “<b>Ngizokulinda</b>” and “<b>Petori to Ibiza</b>,”
  while Senjay and Mhaw Keys can be heard chanting on “<b>Shukushuku</b>” and “<b>Desperado</b>.
  ” Freddy K, like LuuDadeejay on Far Away From Home, is the lone co-producer on “<b>No Mercy.</b>”
   The album’s artwork visually displays Vigro’s solitude (in both his art and sonic direction)
    as he appears sitting in isolation in the dark.
 </p>
 
 <br>
 <p>
 <a href="#">My House My Rules</a> his first release since he’s been out of his deal with Kalawa 
 Jazmee and Universal Music. The 17-track record was released via Rinse — 
 the label division of the London radio station,<a href="#"> Rinse FM</a>, making him the 
 first amapiano act to put out a full project with them. When asked where
  he sees himself in the next two years, by the station’s on-air host <b> DJ Neptizzle</b>,
   Vigro confidently shared his ceaseless ambition of performing at the Belgian-birthed
    dance music festival. “I really see myself playing in <a href="#"> Tomorrowland</a> with the new sound 
    that I have,” he declared unwaveringly, in the April-2022-broadcasted interview.
</p>

</div>
<h2>'5AM set'</h2>

<div class="art">

<p>
“Don't go out too far they said, you haven't got the power / You'll never make it back
 / You’ve got too much to lose they said, told them they were wrong, and I disappeared 
 into the black,” sings an ethereal voice on the third track, “5am Set.” On a July 
 ‘<b>22 Instagram live</b>, the <b>virtuoso</b> showed his creative process as he put the finishing 
 touches on the song by adding an accompanying bassline and keys.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
Throughout the project, Vigro’s vision remains outward. The second track “<u>Gran Turismo</u>,” is
 named after the popular car racing video game, while curtain closer “<u>Desperado</u>,” 
 lifts its name from the Antonio Banderas 1995-released Western blockbuster, and
  also references the melody of  “<b>Alma de Guitarra</b>,” which the movie star infamously 
  debuts during the opening scene of the action-packed film. In the boldly-titled
   “<u>Petori to Ibiza</u>,” the masterful producer invites vocalist <b>M.J</b> to manifest and 
   verbalise his aspiration of playing at the world’s most desired nightclub destination
    hotspot on wax. “Pitori to Ibiza, re tsena ka Sgida,” M.J expresses in the track's refrain.

<br>
<hr>
<p>
Vigro often shares how an encounter with Skrillex in a London studio made him fine-tune 
his current style. “I explained to him where I wanted to go, and he understood and told
 me I had to change this and that. He told me that he knew what I wanted and that I should just be me. 
 ‘If you wanna mix it with dubstep, do you, be you,’” he revealed.

<p>
It’s clear that Vigro Deep is equally radical and intentional with his newest 
stylistic approach. He has willingly chosen to make Amapiano which leans towards
 the sonics of global electronic dance music because that’s the space he's been
  playing in and wants to pursue further. He is a well-traveled DJ/producer that 
  soaks up the different sounds of the countries and places he frequents like the 
  UK or the Netherlands. Vigro creates from an adventurous place of no restriction
   or consideration of what his peers are currently doing. He has pushed himself
    artistically to unfamiliar terrains, and exists in his own world but is kind enough
     to let listeners in from time to time. As YouTube user @nyati86 commented 
     under one of his live-recorded DJ sets, “Vigro deserves a set at <a href="#">Tomorrowland</a>
      and gigs in Ibiza… this is the bridge for Amapiano to the world.”
